# Eight-Ball Pool

## 1. Background and Overview

Eight-ball pool is the most popular form of billiards, played on a six-pocket table. Players play the game using a cue stick to hit and move balls across the table and pocketing them.

Eight-ball pool typically consists of two players, with them taking turns hitting either striped or solid balls into pockets. The game ends when one player hits all balls of their pattern type & ultimately hit a black eight ball into a pocket at the end.

The game begins with 15 colored balls numbered 1-15 (7 solid, 7 striped, and 8-ball) arranged in a triangle, with an additional white cue ball on the opposite side of the pool table. Each turn, the current player will attempt to use the cue ball to hit balls of their color into one of the six pockets.

## 2. Functionality and MVPs

With this Eight-Ball Pool game simulator, users will be able to:

* Start a new two-player game / reset an existing game table
* Maneuver the cue stick around the pool table to aim at balls through the cue ball
* Hit balls around the table once the cue stick is released, potentially landing balls in pockets
* Take turns according to a simplified version of eight-ball pool rules until one player wins by pocketing the eight ball (after hitting all balls of their marking into pockets)

In addition, the following will be included:

* A "How to Play" instructions modal explaining the rules of the game
* A production README

## 3. Wireframes

The eight-ball pool simulator will be on a single screen with the game controls (start/reset), pool table, cue stick, links to the repo and my online presence sites, and the "How to Play" modal.

The cue stick will be movable via mouse moment, where clicking the mouse indicates shooting at the cue ball with the stick.

Below the pool table, the screen will display the balls already pocketed by either of the players.
